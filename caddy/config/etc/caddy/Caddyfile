# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:5003 {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	# Enable the static file server.
	reverse_proxy localhost:5023
	log {
	output file /var/log/caddy/access.log {
		roll_size 1gb
		roll_keep 5
		roll_keep_for 72h
	}
        }    	
	# Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
	# reverse_proxy localhost:8080

	# Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
	# php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
